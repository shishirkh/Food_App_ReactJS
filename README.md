#Food App ReactJS
Though I have worked on my Algorithms&DataStructures for the majority of my college life. 
I decided to try web development in the last 2 weeks as I have always been curious about it!
It was a new experience for me, web development really has a lot of things that one needs to take 
care and think about while working on a project. 
 
I really enjoyed and learned a lot while creating this project. 

Special thanks to all the tutors on the internet who help us learn new skills and become better! 

Do suggest some features for the project.
I plan on hosting it soon as well.

Until then, you can see the images that I have added.
